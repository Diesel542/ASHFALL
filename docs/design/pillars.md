# Design Pillars

The unbreakable rules. Everything we build serves these.

---

## 1. Density Over Scale

One settlement. Five NPCs. One dungeon. One secret.  
Every character a tangle of contradictions.  
Every object a potential key.  
Every conversation a chance to reveal or conceal who you are.

We don't need a hundred locations. We need *depth*.

---

## 2. Consequences That Compound

Choices don't just branch — they *accumulate*.  
What you said to the healer in hour one changes what the leader offers you in hour three.  
Nothing is forgotten. Everything weighs.

The ending isn't calculated from your final choice.  
It's calculated from *all of them*.

## 3. Skills That Speak To You

Your stats aren't passive modifiers. They're voices.  
LOGIC interrupts with cold analysis.  
INSTINCT screams warnings you can't explain.  
EMPATHY whispers what others feel but won't say.  
GHOST drags up memories you tried to bury.

Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they're wrong.  
You learn to trust them — or ignore them — at your own risk.

*These pillars are load-bearing. We don't remove them. We build around them.*
